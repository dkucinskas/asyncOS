mov - "move arg #1 into arg #0" store value into register (values which have a binary representation which only has 1s in the first 8 bits of the representation. In other words, 8 1s or 0s followed by only 0s.)
ldr - "load register" store value into register (from memory)
lsl - "logical shift left" shift the binary representation for the first arg left by the second arg.
str - "store register" store value in first arg into the address computed from the expression afterwards.
